# Loading resources
This is where I want to talk about loading resources from the bundle, including raw JSON files that would be used for initial data/ testing.

TBD - If you would like example's that I don't exactly want to go in to right now, look into the StorageProvider3.swift class in `CoreDataDemo1`. Specifically, `parseMovieDataFromJSON`.
